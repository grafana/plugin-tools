While the PromQL engine works great, it sometimes needs a lot of memory to run, specifically in the Mimir querier component. To address this memory consumption issue, we recently introduced Mimir Query Engine (MQE).

              - generic [ref=e210]: A year ago, we hit a wall. Our Grafana OSS releases were excruciating to execute. The process was confusing and hard to follow, security patches were non-trivial, and many engineering hours were lost to an overly manual process. We needed to move fast, cut through ambiguity, and pull in just the right people without waiting on roadmaps or org charts. That’s when I pitched the idea of forming the first ever “tiger team” at Grafana Labs, a small and focused group designed to tackle high-priority, cross-functional problems with speed and clarity.
