# Create Plugin Migrations Guide

# Agent behaviour

- Follow everything in [global-rule.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/global-rule.mdc)
- Follow eveything in [nx-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nx-rules.mdc)
- Refer to implementation examples [example-migration.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/scripts/example-migration.ts) and [example-migration.test.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/scripts/example-migration.test.ts)
- When creating a new migration add it to the exported migrations object in [migrations.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/migrations.ts)
- Read the file [context.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/context.ts) to know what methods are available on the context class.
- Always check for file existence using the [context.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/context.ts) class before attempting to do anything with it.
- Never write files with any 3rd party npm library. Use the context for all file operations.
- Always return the context for the next migration.
- Test thoroughly using the provided utils in [test-utils.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/src/migrations/test-utils.ts) where necessary.
- Each migration must be idempotent (can run multiple times safely) and must include a test case that uses the .toBeIdempotent custom matcher found in [vitest.setup.ts](mdc:packages/create-plugin/vitest.setup.ts).
- Keep migrations focused on one task.
- Never attempt to read or write files outside the current working directory.

# Naming Conventions

- Each migration lives under `src/migrations`
- Migration filenames follow the format: `NNN-migration-title` where migration-title is, at the most, a three word summary of what the migration does and NNN is the next number in sequence based on the current file name in `src/migrations`.
- Each migration must have:
  - `NNN-migration-title.ts` - main migration logic
  - `NNN-migration-title.test.ts` - migration logic tests
- Each migration should export a default function named "migrate"
