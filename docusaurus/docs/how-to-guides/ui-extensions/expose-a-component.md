Expose components to allow app plugins to easily share functionality with other app plugins. Compared to [registering an extension](./register-an-extension), they do not require the extension provider to explicitly register a component against any extension points, and can therefore be [used by any app plugin](./use-an-exposed-component.md) with no action required by the provider.

## Best practices

- **Wrap your component with providers** - if you want to access any plugin-specific state in your component, make sure to wrap it with the necessary React context providers (for example, a wrapping for Redux).

## Expose a component from an app plugin

You can expose one or multiple components from within the same app plugin. For example:

```tsx
import pluginJson from './plugin.json';

export const plugin = new AppPlugin()
  // You can also expose multiple components from the same app plugin
  .exposeComponent({
    // Important!
    // The `id` should always be prefixed with your plugin id, otherwise it won't be exposed.
    id: `${pluginJson.id}/reusable-component/v1`,
    title: 'Reusable component',
    description: 'A component that can be reused by other app plugins.',
    component: ({ name }: { name: string }) => <div>Hello {name}!</div>,
  });
```

## Access plugin meta information in an exposed component

You can access metadata for the extended component. For example:

```tsx
import { usePluginContext } from "@grafana/runtime";
import pluginJson from './plugin.json';

export const plugin = new AppPlugin()
  .exposeComponent({
    id: `${pluginJson.id}/reusable-component/v1`,
    title: 'Reusable component',
    description: 'A component that can be reused by other app plugins.',
    component: ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
      // This is the meta information of the app plugin that is exposing the component
      const { meta } = usePluginContext();

      return (
        <div>Hello {name}!</div>
        <div>Version {meta.info.version}</div>
      );
    }
  })
```
