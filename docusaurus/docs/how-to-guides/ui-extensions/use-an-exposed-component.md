App plugins can [expose additional functionality through a React component](./expose-a-component.md), which you can then import into your own plugin. Use exposed components to augment your own app plugin with additional features to extend a user workflow.

## Use an exposed component

The following example shows how you can render a component exposed by another plugin in your extension point:

```tsx
import { usePluginComponent } from '@grafana/runtime';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const { component: Component, isLoading } = usePluginComponent('myorg-basic-app/reusable-component/v1');

  return (
    <>
      <div>My component</div>
      {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : <Component name="John" />}
    </>
  );
};
```
