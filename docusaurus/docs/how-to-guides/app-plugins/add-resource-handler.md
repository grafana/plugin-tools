# Add resource handler for app plugins

You can add a resource handler to your app backend to extend the Grafana HTTP API with your own app-specific routes. This guide explains why you may want to add [resource](../../key-concepts/backend-plugins/#resources) handlers and some common ways for doing so.

## Uses of resource handlers

An app often integrates with a HTTP service of some kind, e.g. a 3rd party service, to retrieve and send data. For example, this service might have specific authentication and authorization needs or a response format not suitable to return to Grafana and the plugin frontend.

In addition, you might want to [secure your resources](implement-rbac-in-app-plugins.md#secure-backend-resources) so that only users with a certain permission can access certain routes.

Resource handlers are also useful for building control panels that allow the user to write back to the app. For example, you could add a resource handler to update the state of an IoT device.

## Accessing app resources

Once implemented you can access the resources using the Grafana HTTP API and from the frontend.

### Using the Grafana HTTP API

You can access the resources through the Grafana HTTP API by using the endpoint, `http://<GRAFANA_HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/api/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/resources{/<RESOURCE>}`. The `PLUGIN_ID` is the plugin identifier that uniquely identifies your app and the `RESOURCE` depends on how the resource handler is implemented and what resources (routes) are supported.

With the above example you can access the following resources:

- HTTP GET `http://<GRAFANA_HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/api/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/resources/namespaces`
- HTTP GET `http://<GRAFANA_HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/api/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/resources/projects`

### From the frontend

You can access your resources in a compontent using the `get` function of the `backendSrv` runtime service to send a HTTP GET request to `http://<GRAFANA_HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/api/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/resources/namespaces`

```typescript
import { getBackendSrv } from '@grafana/runtime';

const namespaces = await getBackendSrv().get(`/api/plugins/<PLUGIN_ID>/resources/namespaces`);
```

## Additional examples

Some other examples of using resource handlers and the [`httpadapter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/backend/resource/httpadapter) package:

- The [app-with-backend](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-examples/tree/main/examples/app-with-backend) example:
  - [create resource handler](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-examples/blob/main/examples/app-with-backend/pkg/plugin/app.go) and [register routes](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-examples/blob/main/examples/app-with-backend/pkg/plugin/resources.go) in the backend.
  - use [backendSrv](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-examples/blob/main/examples/app-with-backend/src/pages/PageOne/PageOne.tsx) to call resources.
