# Set up your development environment

This section helps you configure a complete development environment for Grafana plugin development. You'll learn how to set up local development tools and automate your development workflow.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Grafana plugin project created with [`create-plugin`](/get-started.md)
- Docker installed on your system
- A GitHub repository for your plugin (optional, for CI/CD setup)

These guides cover essential development environment setup:

- **Docker environment**: Run a development Grafana server with your plugin installed using Docker.
- **GitHub workflows**: Set up GitHub workflows to automate your development and release process.
- **Configuration extensions**: Extend configurations for ESLint, Prettier, Jest, TypeScript, and Webpack.
