## Update to React Router v6

Starting from Grafana 10, plugins can start using the v6 of `react-router`. Overall, `react-router` v6 aims to simplify route configuration and provide a more flexible and intuitive API for developers.

If your current plugin version needs to maintain compatibility with Grafana v9, then you can continue to use `react-router@v5` in Grafana v10. Both versions are available for plugins. However, **we strongly encourage developers to update their plugins to use the v6 version `react-router` as soon as possible**, as the v5 version is going to be deprecated in Grafana v11 and subsequently removed.

For more general information, refer to the [Official React Router v5 to v6 migration guide](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/upgrading/v5).

### Update using `@grafana/create-plugin`

Follow the steps below to start using `react-router` v6 in your plugin:

#### 1. Update the build related configuration:

Enable using `react-router@v6` by setting the following feature flag in `<project-root>/.cprc.json`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "useReactRouterV6": true
  }
}
```

Now update the build configuration using the create-plugin tool:

<UpdateNPM />

After updating the build configuration, it is likely that you will need to make additional updates to your plugin. To do so, follow the steps below:

#### 2. Use `<Routes>` instead of `<Switch>`

```typescript
// Using <Routes> instead of <Switch> in `react-router` v6
import { Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

// ...

return (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

#### 3. Remove the `exact` prop from `<Route>` components

```typescript
return (
  <Routes>
    {/* BAD (Until v5) */}
    <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />} />

    {/* GOOD (From v6) */}
    {/* (Routes are "exact" by default, you need to use the "*" to match sub-routes) */}
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

#### 4. Follow the original `react-router` migration guide for more in-depth changes
