The [`create-plugin` tool](./get-started.mdx#use-plugin-tools-to-develop-your-plugins-faster) includes a development environment featuring [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It allows you to start an instance of the Grafana application for plugin developers against which you can code.

:::info

It's not necessary to [sign a plugin](/publish-a-plugin/sign-a-plugin.md) during development. The Docker development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` will load the plugin without a signature. This is because it is configured by default to run in [development mode](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md#configure-grafana-for-development).

## Why use the Docker environment

We have chosen to use Docker because it simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. It allows you to create consistent and isolated environments for your plugin. This makes it easy to manage dependencies and ensure that the plugin runs the same way across different machines.

With the `create-plugin` tool, the Docker container is configured with the necessary variables to allow easy access to Grafana and to load plugins without the need for them to be signed. The plugin tool also adds a live reload feature that allows you to make your frontend code changes to trigger refreshes in the browser, and changing the backend code will make the plugin binary to automatically reload.

The docker environment also allows you to attach a debugger to the plugin backend code, making the development process easier.

## Get started with Docker

To start your plugin development project, run the following commands in the order listed:

1. <SyncCommand cmd="install" />: Installs frontend dependencies.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run dev" />: Builds and watches the plugin frontend code.
1. `mage -v build:linux`: Builds the plugin backend code. Rerun this command every time that you edit your backend files.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run server" />: Starts a Grafana development server running on
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Configure the Grafana version

To test a plugin across different versions of Grafana, set an environment variable. Use `GRAFANA_VERSION` to set the Grafana version:

<CodeSnippets
  snippets={[
    { component: DockerNPM, label: 'npm' },
    { component: DockerPNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
    { component: DockerYarn, label: 'yarn' },
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>

### Configure the Grafana image

The default Docker image in the plugin tool is `grafana-enterprise`. If you want to override this image, alter the `docker-compose.yaml` by changing the `grafana_image` build argument like so:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3.7'

services:
  grafana:
    container_name: 'myorg-basic-app'
    build:
      context: ./.config
      args:
        grafana_version: ${GRAFANA_VERSION:-9.1.2}
        grafana_image: ${GRAFANA_IMAGE:-grafana}
```

This example assigns the environment variable `GRAFANA_IMAGE` to the build arg `grafana_image` with a default value of `grafana`. This gives you the option to set the value when running `docker-compose` commands.

### Debugging Backend plugin

If you're developing a plugin with a backend part, run `npm run server` with `DEVELOPMENT=true`. The docker compose file exposes the port `2345` for debugging, from a headless delve instance that will run inside the docker environment.
You can attach a debugger client to this port to debug your backend code.
For example, in VSCode, you can add a `launch.json` configuration like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to plugin backend in docker",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "attach",
      "mode": "remote",
      "port": 2345,
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "showLog": true,
      "trace": "log",
      "logOutput": "rpc",
      "substitutePath": [
        {
          "from": "${workspaceFolder}",
          "to": "/root/<your-plugin-id>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can control the go version and the architecure used to build your plugin in the docker compose by setting `GO_VERSION` and `GO_ARCH` environment variables:
```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3.7'

services:
  grafana:
    container_name: 'myorg-basic-app'
    build:
      context: ./.config
      args:
        GO_VERSION: ${GO_VERSION:-1.22}
        GO_ARCH: ${GO_ARCH:-amd64}
```

You will also notice that the `docker-compose.yaml` file also has the following settings:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
    security_opt:
      - "apparmor:unconfined"
      - "seccomp:unconfined"
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```

they are necessary to allow delve to attach to the running process and debug it and should not be used in production environments.
