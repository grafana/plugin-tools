This guide walks you through setting up your development environment for Grafana plugin development. Including:

- Running a development Grafana server with your plugin installed using Docker
- Setting up GitHub workflows to automate your development and release process
- Extending configurations for ESLint, Prettier, Jest, TypeScript, and Webpack

## Docker development environment

The [`create-plugin` tool](./get-started.mdx#use-plugin-tools-to-develop-your-plugins-faster) includes a development environment featuring [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It allows you to start an instance of the Grafana application for plugin developers against which you can code.

:::info

It's not necessary to [sign a plugin](/publish-a-plugin/sign-a-plugin.md) during development. The Docker development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` will load the plugin without a signature. This is because it is configured by default to run in [development mode](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/developer-guide.md#configure-grafana-for-development).

:::

### Why use the Docker environment

We have chosen to use Docker because it simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. It allows you to create consistent and isolated environments for your plugin. This makes it easy to manage dependencies and ensure that the plugin runs the same way across different machines.

With the `create-plugin` tool, the Docker container is configured with the necessary variables to allow easy access to Grafana and to load plugins without the need for them to be signed. The plugin tool also adds a live reload feature that allows you to make your frontend code changes to trigger refreshes in the browser, and changing the backend code will make the plugin binary to automatically reload.

The docker environment also allows you to attach a debugger to the plugin backend code, making the development process easier.

### Get started with Docker

To start your plugin development project, run the following commands in the order listed:

1. <SyncCommand cmd="install" />: Installs frontend dependencies.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run dev" />: Builds and watches the plugin frontend code.
1. `mage -v build:linux`: Builds the plugin backend code. Rerun this command every time that you edit your backend files.
1. <SyncCommand cmd="run server" />: Starts a Grafana development server running on
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Configure the Grafana version

To test a plugin across different versions of Grafana, set an environment variable. Use `GRAFANA_VERSION` to set the Grafana version:

<DockerNPM />

### Configure the Grafana image

The default Docker image in the plugin tool is `grafana-enterprise`. If you want to override this image, alter the `docker-compose.yaml` by changing the `grafana_image` build argument like so:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: '3.7'

services:
  grafana:
    extends:
      file: .config/docker-compose-base.yaml
      service: grafana
    build:
      args:
        grafana_version: ${GRAFANA_VERSION:-9.1.2}
        grafana_image: ${GRAFANA_IMAGE:-grafana}
```

This example assigns the environment variable `GRAFANA_IMAGE` to the build arg `grafana_image` with a default value of `grafana`. This gives you the option to set the value when running `docker compose` commands.

### Debugging Backend plugin

If you're developing a plugin with a backend part, run `npm run server` with `DEVELOPMENT=true`. The docker compose file exposes the port `2345` for debugging, from a headless delve instance that will run inside the docker environment.
You can attach a debugger client to this port to debug your backend code.
For example, in VSCode, you can add a `launch.json` configuration like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to plugin backend in docker",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "attach",
      "mode": "remote",
      "port": 2345,
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "showLog": true,
      "trace": "log",
      "logOutput": "rpc",
      "substitutePath": [
        {
          "from": "${workspaceFolder}",
          "to": "/root/<your-plugin-id>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Set up GitHub workflows

Automate your development process to minimize errors and make it faster and more cost-efficient. The `create-plugin` tool helps you to configure your GitHub actions workflows to help automate your development process.

### The CI workflow

The CI (`ci.yml`) workflow is designed to lint, type check, and build the frontend and backend. It is also used to run tests on your plugin every time you push changes to your repository. The `create-plugin` tool helps to catch any issues early in the development process, before they become bigger problems. For more information on end-to-end testing as part of the CI workflow, refer to our [documentation](../e2e-test-a-plugin/ci.md).

### The release workflow

To learn how to automate the release process and set up the release workflow, refer to our documentation on [Automate packaging and signing with GitHub CI](../publish-a-plugin/build-automation).

:::warning

This workflow requires a Grafana Cloud API key. Before you begin, follow the instructions for [generating an Access Policy token](../publish-a-plugin/sign-a-plugin#generate-an-access-policy-token).

:::

#### Storing your Access Policy token as a repository secret in GitHub

1. Access Repository Settings:

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to the "Settings" tab.

2. In the left sidebar, click on Secrets and Variables -> Actions
3. Click on the "New repository secret" button.
4. Add Secret Information:

- Enter name for your secret - GRAFANA_ACCESS_POLICY_TOKEN.
- Paste the Access Policy Token value into the "Secret" field.

5. Click on the "Add secret" button to save the secret.

Once the secret is stored, you can access it in your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml title="release.yml"
name: Release

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: grafana/plugin-actions/build-plugin@main
        with:
          grafana_token: ${{ secrets.GRAFANA_ACCESS_POLICY_TOKEN }}
```

In this example, the `secrets.GRAFANA_ACCESS_POLICY_TOKEN` variable is used to access the stored token securely within your GitHub Actions workflow. Make sure to adjust the workflow according to your specific needs and the language/environment you are working with.

#### Triggering the workflow

To trigger the release workflow, push a Git tag for the plugin version that you want to release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### The compatibility check workflow

The compatibility check (`is-compatible.yml`) workflow is designed to check the Grafana API compatibility of your plugin every time you push changes to your repository. This helps to catch potential frontend runtime issues before they occur.

The workflow contains the following steps:

1. Finding `@grafana` npm packages in your plugin.
1. Extracting the exported types of the specified version.
1. Comparing the differences between that version and the latest version.
1. Looking for usages of those changed APIs inside your plugin.
1. Reporting any potential incompatibilities.

### The create plugin update workflow

The create plugin update (`cp-update.yml`) workflow is designed to automate keeping your plugins development environment and dependencies up to date. It periodically checks the latest version of create-plugin listed on the npm registry and compares it to the version used by your plugin. If there is a newer version available the workflow will run the `create-plugin update` command, update the frontend dependency lockfile, then create a PR with the changes for review.

This workflow requires content and pull request write access to your plugins repo to be able to push changes and open PRs. Choose from the following two options:

#### Use the default access token

To use this option you must allow [github actions to create and approve pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#preventing-github-actions-from-creating-or-approving-pull-requests) within your repository settings and use the `permissions` property in the workflow to elevate the default access token permissions like so:

```yaml
name: Create Plugin Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *' # run once a month on the 1st day

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: grafana/plugin-actions/create-plugin-update@main
```

#### Use a personal access token

To use this option you must create a Github [fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with access to the plugin repository and permission to read and write both `contents` and `pull requests`. Once created add the token to the plugin repository action secrets and then pass it to the action like so:

```yaml
name: Create Plugin Update

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *' # run once a month on the 1st day

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: grafana/plugin-actions/create-plugin-update@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT_TOKEN }}
```

### The bundle stats workflow

The bundle stats (`bundle-stats.yml`) workflow is intended to help developers keep an eye on the size of their plugins frontend assets. Changes in PRs trigger this workflow which will compare two webpack stats files; one from the default branch and the other from the PR. It then calculates differences between these assets sizes and posts a formatted comment to the PR giving an overview of any size differences.

```yaml title="bundle-stats.yml"
name: Bundle Stats

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  actions: read

jobs:
  compare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: grafana/plugin-actions/bundle-size@main
```

## Extend configurations

The `.config/` directory holds the preferred configuration for the different tools used to develop, test, and build a Grafana plugin. Although you can make changes, we recommend against doing so. Instead, follow the guidance in this topic to customize your tooling configs.

:::danger

Do not edit the `.config/` directory or extend the tooling configurations. If you attempt to do so, then you may experience issues such as failure to compile or load in Grafana. Instead of changing the files directly, follow the instructions in this topic to make advanced configurations.

:::

### Extend the ESLint config

Edit the `.eslintrc` file in the project root to extend the ESLint configuration:

**Example:**

```json title=".eslintrc"
{
  // Eslint configuration provided by @grafana/create-plugin
  "extends": "./.config/.eslintrc",
  "rules": {
    "react/prop-types": "off"
  }
}
```

The following example can be used to disable deprecation notices.

```json title=".eslintrc"
{
  // Eslint configuration provided by @grafana/create-plugin
  "extends": "./.config/.eslintrc",
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
      "rules": {
        "deprecation/deprecation": "off"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Extend the Prettier config

Edit the `.prettierrc.js` file in the project root to extend the Prettier configuration:

**Example:**

```js title=".prettierrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // Prettier configuration provided by @grafana/create-plugin
  ...require('./.config/.prettierrc.js'),
  semi: false,
};
```

---

### Extend the Jest config

There are two files in the project root that belong to Jest: `jest-setup.js` and `jest.config.js`.

**`jest-setup.js`:** This file is run before each test file in the suite is executed. It sets up Jest DOM for the testing library and applies some polyfills. For more information, refer to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#setupfilesafterenv-array).

**`jest.config.js`:** This is the Jest config file that extends the Grafana config. For more information, refer to the [Jest configuration documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration).

#### ESM errors with Jest

If you see `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` when running Jest or `npm run test` see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting#i-get-syntaxerror-cannot-use-import-statement-outside-a-module-when-running-jest-or-npm-run-test).

---

### Extend the TypeScript config

To extend the TS configuration, edit the `tsconfig.json` file in the project root:

**Example:**

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  // TypeScript configuration provided by @grafana/create-plugin
  "extends": "./.config/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "preserveConstEnums": true
  }
}
```

---

### Extend the Webpack config

Follow these steps to extend the Webpack configuration that lives in `.config/`:

#### 1. Create a new Webpack configuration file

Create a `webpack.config.ts` file in the project root. This file extends the Webpack config provided by `create-plugin`.

#### 2. Merge the Grafana config with your custom config

Use the following [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge) command:

```ts title="webpack.config.ts"
import type { Configuration } from 'webpack';
import { merge } from 'webpack-merge';
import grafanaConfig from './.config/webpack/webpack.config';

const config = async (env): Promise<Configuration> => {
  const baseConfig = await grafanaConfig(env);

  return merge(baseConfig, {
    // Add custom config here...
    output: {
      asyncChunks: true,
    },
  });
};

export default config;
```

The following alternative customization excludes "libs" via rules in addition to "node_modules". It also provides fallbacks that are no longer present in Webpack v5.

```ts title="webpack.config.ts"
import type { Configuration } from 'webpack';
import { mergeWithRules } from 'webpack-merge';
import grafanaConfig from './.config/webpack/webpack.config';

const config = async (env: any): Promise<Configuration> => {
  const baseConfig = await grafanaConfig(env);
  const customConfig = {
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          exclude: /(node_modules|libs)/,
        },
      ],
    },
    resolve: {
      fallback: {
        crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
        fs: false,
        path: require.resolve('path-browserify'),
        stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
        util: require.resolve('util'),
      },
    },
  };
  return mergeWithRules({
    module: {
      rules: {
        exclude: 'replace',
      },
    },
  })(baseConfig, customConfig);
};

export default config;
```

#### 3. Update the `package.json` to use the new Webpack config

Update the `scripts` in the `package.json` to use the extended Webpack configuration:

```diff title="package.json"
-"build": "webpack -c ./.config/webpack/webpack.config.ts --env production",
+"build": "webpack -c ./webpack.config.ts --env production",
-"dev": "webpack -w -c ./.config/webpack/webpack.config.ts --env development",
+"dev": "webpack -w -c ./webpack.config.ts --env development",
```
