# Translate plugins

The Grafana UI can be [displayed in several languages](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-preferences/#change-grafana-language). You can find the [list of available languages](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-i18n/src/constants.ts) in GitHub.

By default, plugins are available in English only and are not translated when you change your language settings. To learn how to translate your plugin, refer to the [Translate your plugin](../how-to-guides/plugin-internationalization.md) how-to guide.

:::note
Grafana uses the [i18next internationalization framework](https://www.i18next.com/) for translation purposes.
