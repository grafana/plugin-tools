:::caution

Each submitted plugin is manually reviewed by the Grafana Plugins team. Following [best practices](./publishing-best-practices.md) or [providing a test environment](./provide-test-environment.md) does not guarantee the approval of a submitted plugin. The Grafana Plugins team studies each submission individually and decides on a case-by-case basis. 

Refer to [Plugin submission review](./publish-or-update-a-plugin.md#plugin-submission-review) for more details.
