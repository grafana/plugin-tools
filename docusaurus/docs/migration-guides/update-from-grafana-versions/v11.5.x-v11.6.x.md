# Migrate plugins from Grafana version 11.5.x to 11.6.x

Follow these instructions to migrate plugins from Grafana version 11.5.x to 11.6.x.

## usePluginComponents options changed in @grafana/runtime

We updated the hook's options TypeScript type due to accidentally using an incorrect deprecated type. This change was delivered to the core `grafana` repo with [PR 100949](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/100949).

**Recommended actions:**

- Remove the `context` property when calling the `usePluginComponents`. The `context` should be passed to each Component as props.

**Please note:**
This is a build time error and won't have any effect during the runtime of Grafana.
