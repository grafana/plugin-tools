# Migrate plugins from Grafana version 10.x to 11.x

Follow these instructions to migrate plugins from Grafana version 10.x to 11.x

## Query filtering in data source plugins

Over the years, query filtering and hiding in data source plugins has been causing confusion among developers and users. In Grafana 11, we're introducing a few [changes](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/84656) that addresses this.

### Responses associated with hidden queries will be removed automatically by Grafana

Responses that are associated with queries where `hide: true` will be removed by Grafana. Queries where `hide: true` will still be executed unless they're prevented from it in the data source `filterQuery` method, but the associated responses will no longer be passed to the panel. To align the UI with this behaviour, the tooltip in the query editor row is changed from `Disable query` to `Hide response/Show response`.

### The `filterQuery` method will be called before the `query` method

For data sources that extend `DataSourceWithBackend`, the `filterQuery` method is now called **before** the data source `query` method. If the `filterQuery` method assumes that some kind of query migration happens before this method is called, you now need to do the migration inside this method.
