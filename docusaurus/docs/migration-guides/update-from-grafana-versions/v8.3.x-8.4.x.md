### `LocationService` replaces `getLocationSrv`

In a previous release, we migrated to use a new routing system and introduced a new service for managing locations, navigation, and related information. In this release, we are making that new service the primary service.

**Example:**

Import the service:

```ts
// before
import { getLocationSrv } from '@grafana/runtime';

// after
import { locationService } from '@grafana/runtime';
```

**Example:**

Navigate to a path and add a new record in the navigation history so that you can navigate back to the previous one:

```ts
// before
getLocationSrv.update({
  path: '/route-to-navigate-to',
  replace: false,
});

// after
locationService.push('/route-to-navigate-to');
```

**Example:**

Navigate to a path and replace the current record in the navigation history:

```ts
// before
getLocationSrv.update({
  path: '/route-to-navigate-to',
  replace: true,
});

// after
locationService.replace('/route-to-navigate-to');
```

**Example:**

Update the search or query parameter for the current route and add a new record in the navigation history so that you can navigate back to the previous one:

```ts
// How to navigate to a new path
// before
getLocationSrv.update({
  query: {
    value: 1,
  },
  partial: true,
  replace: false,
});

// after
locationService.partial({ value: 1 });
```

**Example:** Update the search or query parameter for the current route and add replacing it in the navigation history:

```ts
// before
getLocationSrv.update({
  query: {
    'var-variable': 1,
  },
  partial: true,
  replace: true,
});

// after
locationService.partial({ 'var-variable': 1 }, true);
```
