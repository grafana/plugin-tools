import MigrateNPM from '@shared/createplugin-migrate.md';

The `@grafana/toolkit` tool is now [deprecated](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/breaking-changes/breaking-changes-v10-0/#grafanatoolkit-cli-commands-have-been-removed-and-migrated-to-the-create-plugin-package). If you are still using `@grafana/toolkit` to scaffold and develop plugins, follow this guide to make the jump to our newest plugin tools.

:::warning
Our plugin tools use ReactJS. We [do not support](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/angular_deprecation/) plugins written in Angular.

## Benefits of migrating to the `create-plugin` tool

- **More flexible:** With `create-plugin`, you have more control over your plugins and its dependencies. The additional control translates into greater ease of customizing the tooling to fit your specific needs.
- **Faster development:** With its out-of-the-box development environment, `create-plugin` can significantly reduce development time compared to using `grafana-toolkit`.
- **Improved testing capabilities:** Easily test plugins with `create-plugin` GitHub workflows that automate unit and e2e test runs whenever you push changes to GitHub.
- **Technical support:** The `grafana-toolkit` tool is deprecated and no longer supported by Grafana.
- **Better documentation:** The documentation for `create-plugin` is more comprehensive and easier to discover than `grafana-toolkit`.

## Migrate your plugin to create-plugin

1. Perform a back up of all your current files. We recommend that you store the plugin code in a Git repository and run the command on a clean branch so that you can easily identify changes made by the migration command.

1. In the root directory of the existing plugin (where the `package.json` file is), run the following command.

<MigrateNPM />

1. Follow the prompts that appear. Refer to the list below for details about each potential prompt.

## Prompts

When running the `migrate` command, the following prompts appear. Because of their destructive nature, the prompts have a default value of `no`.

### The following files will be overriden. Would you like to continue?

Select `y` to replace the following files and folders in the plugin directory, or create them if they don't exist:

```
myplugin-directory/
├── .config/
├── .eslintrc
├── .nvmrc
├── .prettierrc.js
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── jest-setup.js
├── jest.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

### The following files are required. Can we scaffold them for you?

Select `y` to make sure a `CHANGELOG.md` file exists in the plugin directory.

### The following files are possibly not needed anymore. Are you ok with us removing them?

Select `y` to delete the following files and folders in the plugin directory:

```
myplugin-directory/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── webpack/
├── .webpack/
└── .prettierrc
```

### Would you like to update the following dependencies in the package.json?

Select `y` to update all the npm dependencies listed by the prompt. The command purposely avoids updating `@grafana` npm dependencies to reduce potential friction during migration.

### Would you like to remove the following possibly unnecessary NPM dependencies?

Select `y` to delete the following npm dependencies found in `package.json`:

```diff json
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "ts-loader": "*",
-   "babel-loader": "*",
-   "@grafana/toolkit": "*"
  }
}
```

### Would you like to update the scripts in your package.json? All scripts using `grafana-toolkit` will be replaced.

This step updates any npm scripts in the `package.json` file to match the latest configurations. Any scripts that previously used `grafana-toolkit` are replaced.

## Next steps

When the migration command finishes running, follow these following steps:

1. Inspect the changes that were introduced, and then install frontend dependencies.

1. Run each npm script inside `package.json` to confirm that the plugin can be built, tested, and signed.

If the plugin had customizations to the toolkit configs (for example, webpack), then refer to [Extend configurations](../get-started/set-up-development-environment.mdx#extend-configurations) to learn how to update them.

If the plugin can be built, but there are problems with Jest tests, then see the [Jest advanced configuration](../get-started/set-up-development-environment.mdx#esm-errors-with-jest) issue regarding es modules.
