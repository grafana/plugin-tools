## Development

There are a collection of [commands](#commmands) to assist with developing the website. Please read the main [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing any code or documentation changes to the project.

### Commmands

Below are the main commands used for developing the website. They can be run by either `npx nx run website:<name_of_command>`, `npm run <name_of_command> -w website` or navigating to `docusaurus/website` and running the command directly as detailed below.

```shell
npm run start # starts a local development server to preview changes as files are edited.
```

```shell
npm run build # creates a production build of the website.
```

```shell
npm run serve # use this command to run the production build locally (requires the build command to be run first).
```

```shell
npm run clear # clears the docusaurus cache
```

## Deployment

During development branches can be manually deployed to the [development website](https://grafana-dev.com/developers/plugin-tools) by doing the following:

1. Navigate to [this actions page](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-tools/actions/workflows/deploy-to-developer-portal-dev.yml).
1. Click `Run workflow` dropdown found above the recent workflow runs table.
1. In the dropdown replace `Which branch to use?` with the name of the branch you'd like to deploy.

To deploy changes to production simply merge a PR to main and wait for the developer portal production workflow to run.
